			<h2>Paying for Your Vehicle</h2>
			<p>
				Depending on what state you live in, you can choose to lease the
				vehicle, purchase with financing or purchase outright. You may also
				be able to trade in your current vehicle and apply the trade-in
				value toward your new A&O vehicle purchase. Prior to your delivery
				date, confirm your payment method with your A&O Advisor and pay the
				amount due in your A&O Account. For final payment, we accept:
				Electronic check (direct debit) in the A&O app Wire transfer
				Certified check at time of delivery with your Reference Number (RN)
				and name in the memo line Note: The total amount for your final
				payment must come from a single account. Leasing and financing are
				contingent on credit approval and not available in all states

			<h2>Taking Delivery of Your Vehicle</h2>
			<p>
				Once your vehicle is ready, a A&O Advisor will review your delivery
				options and available locations with you. To prepare for delivery
				day and ensure you have a seamless experience, we recommend
				completing all pre-delivery tasks in advance, such as submitting
				your insurance details, final payment, trade-in payoff amounts and
				other necessary documents prior to your appointment.
