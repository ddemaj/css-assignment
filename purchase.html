            Once you decide which model is right for you, you can place your
            order online or visit an A&O store. The ordering process only takes
            a few minutes.

          <h1>Paying for Your Vehicle</h1>
          <p>
            Depending on what state you live in, you can choose to lease the
            vehicle, purchase with financing or purchase outright. You may also
            be able to trade in your current vehicle and apply the trade-in
            value toward your new A&O vehicle purchase. Prior to your delivery
            date, confirm your payment method with your A&O Advisor and pay the
            amount due in your A&O Account. For final payment, we accept:
            Electronic check (direct debit) in the A&O app Wire transfer
            Certified check at time of delivery with your Reference Number (RN)
            and name in the memo line Note: The total amount for your final
            payment must come from a single account. Leasing and financing are
            contingent on credit approval and not available in all states

          <h1>Taking Delivery of Your Vehicle</h1>
          <p>
            Once your vehicle is ready, a A&O Advisor will review your delivery
            options and available locations with you. To prepare for delivery
            day and ensure you have a seamless experience, we recommend
            completing all pre-delivery tasks in advance, such as submitting
            your insurance details, final payment, trade-in payoff amounts and
            other necessary documents prior to your appointment.
