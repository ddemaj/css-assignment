            Once you decide which model is right for you, you can place your
            order online or visit an A&O store. The ordering process only takes
            a few minutes.

          <h1>Paying for Your Vehicle</h1>
          <p>
            Depending on what state you live in, you can choose to lease the
            vehicle, purchase with financing or purchase outright. You may also
            be able to trade in your current vehicle and apply the trade-in
            value toward your new A&O vehicle purchase.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to your delivery date, confirm your payment method with your
            A&O Advisor and pay the amount due in your A&O Account.
          </p>
          <p>For final payment, we accept:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <span> Electronic check (direct debit) in the A&O app</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Wire transfer</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>
                Certified check at time of delivery with your Reference Number
                (RN) and name
              </span>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong>
            The total amount for your final payment must come from a single
            account. Leasing and financing are contingent on credit approval and
            not available in all states

          <h1>Taking Delivery of Your Vehicle</h1>
          <p>
            Once your vehicle is ready, a A&O Advisor will review your delivery
            options and available locations with you.
          </p>
          To prepare for delivery day and ensure you have a seamless experience,
          we recommend completing all pre-delivery tasks in advance, such as
          submitting your insurance details, final payment, trade-in payoff
          amounts and other necessary documents prior to your appointment.
